Project Overview
This project involved creating a course planning application for ABC Universityâ€™s Computer Science department. My goal was to develop a command-line program that reads course data from a CSV file, stores it in a suitable data structure, and provides functionalities to display a list of courses and detailed course information, including prerequisites. This application assists academic advisors in accessing course information efficiently.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem addressed in these projects was to develop a software application that helps academic advisors at ABC University efficiently access and manage course information for their computer science curriculum. The application needed to read data from a CSV file, store it in an appropriate data structure, and provide functionalities to display and query course details and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To tackle the problem, I began by analyzing the requirements and deciding on the most suitable data structure to store the course information. Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly impact the efficiency and performance of an application. I chose to use an unordered_map to store the courses due to its fast lookup times, which are beneficial when querying specific course information. The unordered_map allows efficient insertion and retrieval operations, which is ideal for the given application.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
While working on the project, I encountered several challenges, such as handling file input/output, validating data formats, and ensuring the correct implementation of data structures. To overcome these roadblocks, I referred to documentation and examples, and utilized debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues. Additionally, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks helped me systematically address each challenge.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has broadened my approach to software design and development by emphasizing the importance of planning and designing before coding. I learned to carefully select data structures based on the specific needs of the application, which improved the efficiency and performance of my program. The project also highlighted the significance of modularity and clear organization in code, which are essential for developing maintainable and scalable software.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has significantly influenced my coding practices, making my programs more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I now prioritize writing clean and well-documented code, which includes using meaningful variable names, adding comments to explain logic, and following consistent formatting. Moreover, I have learned to design my programs with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy updates and modifications in the future. These practices ensure that my code can be easily understood and maintained by others, as well as adapted to changing requirements.

Conclusion
Overall, this project has been an invaluable learning experience, enhancing my understanding of data structures, software design, and coding best practices. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be instrumental in my future endeavors as a software developer, enabling me to create efficient, maintainable, and adaptable software solutions.
